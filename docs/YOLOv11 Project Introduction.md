#### 2.6.2 cfg (key)

Under this folder our model configuration files are saved, the cfg directory is the centralised place for project configuration, which includes:

**datasets**: contains dataset configuration files, such as data path, category information, etc. (that is, we need a dataset when we train the YOLO model, which saves part of the dataset yaml file, if we do not specify the dataset when we train then it will automatically download the dataset file in it, but it is easy to fail!) If we don't specify a dataset when we train then we will download the dataset file automatically, but it will easily fail!

**models**: stores the model configuration file, defines the model structure and training parameters, this is our improvement or on the basic version of a yaml file configuration place.

> **yolov8.yaml**: this is the standard configuration file for the YOLOv8 model, defining the model's infrastructure and parameters.
>
> **yolov8-cls.yaml**: the configuration file adapts the YOLOv8 model specifically for image classification tasks.
>
> **yolov8-ghost.yaml**: application of the YOLOv8 variant of the Ghost module, designed to improve computational efficiency.
>
> **yolov8-ghost-p2.yaml and yolov8-ghost-p6.yaml**: these files are configurations of the Ghost model variants for specific size inputs.
>
> **yolov8-p2.yaml and yolov8-p6.yaml**: YOLOv8 model configurations for different processing levels (e.g., different input partition rates or model depths).
>
> **yolov8-pose.yaml**: YOLOv8 model configurations customised for pose estimation tasks.
>
> **yolov8-pose-p6.yaml**: pose estimation task for larger input partition rates or more complex model architectures.
>
> **yolov8-rtdetr.yaml**: may indicate a YOLOv8 model variant for real-time detection and tracking.
>
> **yolov8-seg.yaml and yolov8-seg-p6.yaml**: these are YOLOv8 model configurations customised for semantic segmentation tasks.

`solutions/default.yaml`: This configuration file is designed for the Solution Module of Ultralytics YOLO and is used for the setup of target counting, heat map generation, motion monitoring, data analysis and safety alarm systems.
